# Task: P2-02-dialer-and-call-controls

## Status
- [ ] Pending
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Verified
- [ ] Complete

## Pillars

### 1. Model
opus

### 2. Tools Required
- [x] Read, Edit, Write (file operations)
- [x] Bash: `bunx tsc --noEmit`
- [x] Grep, Glob (search)
- [ ] WebFetch (external docs)
- [ ] Task (sub-agents)

### 3. Guardrails (DO NOT)
- [ ] Do NOT modify: `components/ui/*`, `lib/engine/*`, `lib/store/lead-store.ts` (extend, don't change)
- [ ] Do NOT auto-dial: agent must explicitly click "Call" button
- [ ] Do NOT skip: microphone permission request handling (graceful error if denied)
- [ ] Do NOT break: existing lead detail view layout or quote functionality

### 4. Knowledge (MUST READ)
- [x] CLAUDE.md (always)
- [ ] Specific files: `lib/store/call-store.ts` (from P2-01), `lib/telnyx/client.ts` (from P2-01), `components/leads/lead-detail-client.tsx` (where dialer integrates)
- [ ] Reference repo: `src/components/Dialer.tsx`, `src/components/ActiveCall.tsx`, `src/components/Keyboard.tsx`, `src/components/CallNotificationHandler.tsx`
- [ ] Current state audit: Lead detail has a header with lead name/info. The "Call" button needs to go here.

### 5. Memory
- [x] N/A (fresh context)

### 6. Success Criteria
- [ ] `components/calling/call-button.tsx` — click-to-call button in lead detail header, shows lead phone number, disabled if no phone
- [ ] `components/calling/active-call-bar.tsx` — appears during active call: timer (mm:ss), mute button, hold button, DTMF keypad button, hangup button
- [ ] `components/calling/dtmf-keypad.tsx` — modal with 0-9, *, # buttons for sending DTMF tones during call
- [ ] `components/calling/call-notification-handler.tsx` — invisible component that listens to TelnyxRTC notification events and updates call-store
- [ ] Call lifecycle works: click Call → connecting → ringing → active (timer starts) → hangup (timer stops, state resets)
- [ ] Mute toggle works (toggles audio, icon changes)
- [ ] Hold toggle works (puts call on hold, icon changes)
- [ ] DTMF sends tones during active call
- [ ] Error handling: mic denied → clear error message, call failed → toast with reason, network drop → reconnect attempt
- [ ] `<audio>` element for remote audio (caller hears the other party)
- [ ] Verification command: `bunx tsc --noEmit` exits 0

### 7. Dependencies
- [x] Task P2-01 must be complete (SDK installed, call store exists, token endpoint works)
- [ ] Telnyx portal configured and credentials in .env.local

### 8. Failure Handling
**Max attempts:** 3

**On failure (per attempt):**
- [ ] Retry with different approach
- [ ] If WebRTC connection fails: check browser compatibility, try with `webrtc-adapter` polyfill

**After max attempts exhausted:**
- [ ] Save error to `ERRORS/P2-02-dialer-and-call-controls.md` and STOP

**Rollback command:** `git stash && git checkout HEAD~1`

### 9. Learning
**Log to LEARNINGS.md if:**
- [ ] TelnyxRTC notification events have different structure than documented
- [ ] Audio element needs specific handling for WebRTC streams (srcObject vs src)
- [ ] Browser auto-play policies block remote audio — may need user gesture
- [ ] Hold/unhold has edge cases (call drops on hold, etc.)

---

## Human Checkpoint
- [x] **REQUIRED** — Test with a real phone call to a known number. Agent must verify: can hear remote party, remote party can hear agent, mute works, call ends cleanly.

---

## Description
Build the click-to-call dialer UI and full call controls. When an agent views a lead with a phone number, they see a "Call" button. Clicking it initiates a Telnyx WebRTC call to that number. During the call, a persistent bar shows call controls (timer, mute, hold, DTMF, hangup). This is the core telephony UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Call" button visible in lead detail header when lead has phone number
- [ ] "Call" button hidden/disabled when: no phone, already in a call, no Telnyx connection
- [ ] Active call bar sticks to top of lead detail view (doesn't scroll away)
- [ ] Call timer counts up from 00:00 (updates every second)
- [ ] Mute/unmute toggles audio with visual indicator (icon changes, button style changes)
- [ ] Hold/unhold works with visual indicator
- [ ] DTMF keypad opens as popover/modal, sends tones on button press
- [ ] Hangup button ends call, resets all state, stops timer
- [ ] Remote audio plays through browser (uses `<audio>` element with srcObject)
- [ ] Microphone permission requested on first call — if denied, show clear error
- [ ] CallNotificationHandler updates store on: callUpdate (state changes), userMediaError, error
- [ ] Toast notifications for: call connected, call ended, call failed, mic denied

## Steps (high-level)
1. Create `components/calling/call-notification-handler.tsx` — listens to TelnyxRTC `telnyx.notification` events, dispatches to call-store
2. Create `components/calling/call-button.tsx` — reads lead phone from store, initiates call via callStore.initiateCall(phoneNumber)
3. Create `components/calling/active-call-bar.tsx` — shows during active/ringing/held states, renders timer + controls
4. Create `components/calling/dtmf-keypad.tsx` — 4x3 grid keypad, sends call.dtmf(digit) on press
5. Create `components/calling/remote-audio.tsx` — hidden `<audio>` element that attaches to call's remote MediaStream
6. Add CallNotificationHandler to leads layout (mounts once, listens globally)
7. Add CallButton to lead detail header
8. Add ActiveCallBar to lead detail view (conditionally rendered when call active)
9. Wire call lifecycle: initiateCall() → client.newCall({destinationNumber, callerNumber}) → notification handler → store updates → UI reacts
10. Add useInterval hook for call timer (updates callDuration every second while call is active)
11. Test with a real call

## On Completion
- **Commit:** `feat: add dialer UI with call controls, mute, hold, DTMF`
- **Update:** [x] CLAUDE.md (add components/calling/ to directory structure)
- **Handoff notes:** Agent can now make outbound calls from lead detail view. Call state is managed in Zustand. Task P2-03 adds live transcription (captures audio stream). Task P2-04 adds the transcript UI to the AI panel.

## Notes
- Reference `src/components/ActiveCall.tsx` from the Telnyx demo for call control patterns. They use `call.muteAudio()`, `call.hold()`, `call.dtmf(digit)`, `call.hangup()`.
- Reference `src/components/CallNotificationHandler.tsx` for how to listen to `telnyx.notification` events and extract call state.
- The `<audio>` element approach: set `audioRef.current.srcObject = call.remoteStream` when call goes active. Reference `src/components/ActiveCall.tsx` for this pattern.
- The active call bar should be compact (one horizontal row) — it lives above the three-column layout, not inside a panel.
- Consider adding a small "calling..." overlay or animation during the ringing state.
- callerNumber should come from env or Telnyx config (the purchased Telnyx number), not from the lead record.
